# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of key data structures and algorithms developed as part of coursework in **Algorithms and Data Structures**. The exercises were written in **Python**, with some numerical computations supported by **NumPy**.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy

## Problem Descriptions

### ðŸ§ª Lab 1 â€“ Matrix Class: Transposition and Chio's Determinant Method  
Implemented a custom `Matrix` class in Python with support for:
- Matrix transposition
- Determinant calculation using **Chio's method**, a recursive technique for efficient determinant computation

NumPy was used for verification and comparison of results.

### ðŸ§ª Lab 2 â€“ Linked List Structures  
Created fundamental linked data structures from scratch:
- **Singly linked list** with basic operations (insert, delete, traversal)
- **Doubly linked list** supporting bidirectional traversal and node manipulation
