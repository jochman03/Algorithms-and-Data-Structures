# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of key data structures and algorithms developed as part of coursework in **Algorithms and Data Structures**. The exercises were written in **Python**, with some numerical computations supported by **NumPy**.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy

## Problem Descriptions

### Lab 1 – Matrix Class: Transposition and Chio's Determinant Method  
Implemented a custom `Matrix` class in Python with support for:
- Matrix transposition
- Determinant calculation using **Chio's method**, a recursive technique for efficient determinant computation

NumPy was used for verification and comparison of results.

### Lab 2 – Linked List Structures  
- **Singly linked list** with basic operations (insert, delete, traversal)
- **Doubly linked list** supporting bidirectional traversal and node manipulation

### Lab 3 – Queue and Unrolled Linked List
- **Queue** using a dynamically reallocated array
- **Unrolled linked list** combining array blocks with linked structure

### Lab 4 – Hash Table and Skip List
- **Hash table** with basic hashing and collision resolution
- **Skip list** supporting fast search and update operations

### Lab 5 – Tree Structures
- **Binary search tree** with standard operations
- **AVL tree** with automatic rebalancing after insert/delete
